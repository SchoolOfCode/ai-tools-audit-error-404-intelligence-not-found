# TestFirst - Free, Cloud-based Test Management System (founded by Bugra Kara, 2023)

## What is TestFirst?
- TestFirst is a cheap, modern, cloud-based test management system with unlimited features and storage. TestFirst helps QA and development teams manage their testing process efficiently.

- TestFirst is a productivity-focused tool and comes pre-equipped with assistive testing modules that make the software testing process exponentially faster.

- It manages your test projects, creates test plans, runs tests, annotates screenshots, reports bugs, tracks project releases, generates reports and provides testing progress.

- All testing artifacts, such as test cases, test results, screenshots and attachments, are kept on the cloud 24/7, accessible globally.

## Opportunity
- Using TestFirst, the TechForge Industries QA team would be able to test new and old features faster and use the Test Execution Model(TEM) to automate tests with plain language pseudocode
- TestFirst also makes use of screenshots to highlight when a test passes and fails
- TestFirst provides a streamlined platform for automating tests directly from a browser. It addresses challenges like fragmented testing processes and lack of real-time collaboration by centralizing test execution, reporting, and version control integration. This can enhance current testing workflows by allowing continuous integration (CI) with popular frameworks like Jest, reducing human error, and improving overall test coverage.

## Risks
- Potential risks include dependency on cloud-based platforms, which could pose compliance and security concerns regarding sensitive data.
- The learning curve for new team members may also slow initial adoption.
- TestFirst can only be downloaded and accessed on using Microsoft at the moment as the tool is.

## Tangible Benefit
- TestFirst promises increased productivity through automated workflows and real-time feedback. 
- By reducing manual testing, it can result in significant time savings. Furthermore, by catching bugs earlier, there could be reduced costs associated with later-stage defect fixes.
- Generated reports and TestFirst website UI could aid our QA team in communicating and collaborating with our other teams, like DevOps and SecOps, seamlessly.

## Evaluation
While TestFirst is relatively new, careful integration with a focus on security compliance and team training will mitigate risks. The benefits, especially in time and cost efficiency, make it a promising tool for TechForge Industries, warranting a trial implementation.
